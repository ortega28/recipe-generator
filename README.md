Wireframes: The proposed layout and design of your app. Create mockups for multiple views, including both desktop and mobile formats, and consider whether or not you need to account for landscape and portrait orientations.

MVP: A list of features you will need to build in order to meet the Minimum Viable Product. This will be the rubric your project will be graded against.

1) Allow user to input into search
2) Find external API and use to find recipes
3) Render data on page below search


Post-MVP: A list of additional/advanced features you would like to include in your app after you have met MVP.

1) Have a "favorite" button or star image and saves the favorites in local storage
2) Add hover effects on recipes
3) Add picture transition effects / maybe change main image to change to recipe when recipe is clicked
